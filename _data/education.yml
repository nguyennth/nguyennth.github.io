    My dissertation was mainly about information extraction from biomedical texts. Specifically, I built an unsupervised relation extraction system that can locate every possible association between two entities in a sentence. My system is similar to an Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) one in terms that it does not require a pre-defined schema for relations or entities. Relations was extracted based on Predicate-Argument Structure (PAS) patterns.

    I did Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) in my thesis, in particular to translate documents from English to Vietnamese. My work tackled the issue of word ordering between Vietnamese and English by using a probablistic model to decide whether the system should reorder components in a phrase before translating.

    For the first time in my life, I learnt how to code a program in Pascal (not sure if anybody know about its existence), C, and C++, which I believe is still useful for me until now.
    
    My thesis was about Information Retrieval (IR) in which my classmate and I were trying to implement a cross-language IR system that allowed users to search both Vietnamese and English documents by inputting Vietnamese keywords. We simply used a dictionary and intergrated with a Google API. We also extended the system to Chinese as well.
