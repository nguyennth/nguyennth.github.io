  Hello, my name's Nhung (the Nh is pronounced like Ã‘ in Spanish). I'm now a Scientist in NLP at [Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine](https://www.janssen.com/johnson-johnson-innovative-medicine). Prior to this, I was a presidential fellow at the Deparment of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester. 
 
  My main research is about text mining and natural language processing in the biomedical domain.

  My publications are listed [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=UY3KrtIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
